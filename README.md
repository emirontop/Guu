## üìå What Is This?

This repository contains a **lightly customized version** of the Obsidian UI system, specifically integrated into a **Roblox script GUI (exploit GUI)**.  
The UI was reused because of its clean design and structure, and this fork serves as a personal learning reference and non-commercial tool.

No core architecture or logic was significantly changed. The design, patterns, and layout are attributed fully to the original author.
